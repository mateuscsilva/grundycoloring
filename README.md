# BRKGA and Formulations for the paper Obtaining the Grundy chromatic number: How bad can my greedy heuristic coloring be?

## This project implements a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) and integer programming formulations for the Grundy coloring problem used in the paper Obtaining the Grundy chromatic number: How bad can my greedy heuristic coloring be?

The BRKGA code for the problem was developed using the [brkgaApi](https://github.com/rfrancotoso/brkgaAPI) framework. 

### Organization

1. brkgaGrundy: folder that contains the codes related to brkga in C++.
2. src: folder that contains the codes related to the formulations in Julia.
3. instances: folder that contains the set of instances used in the tests
